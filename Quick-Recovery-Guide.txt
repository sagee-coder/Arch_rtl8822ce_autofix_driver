🧭 Quick Recovery Guide — Realtek RTL8822CE Wi-Fi (Arch Linux)

🧩 When to Use
Use this if:
- Wi-Fi option suddenly disappears after update/reboot
- You did a fresh Arch install
- Kernel got updated and Wi-Fi broke again

This guide restores and hardens your RTL8822CE driver setup.

⚙️ Clone the Repo
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/arch-rtl8822ce-autofix.git
cd arch-rtl8822ce-autofix

🧹 Optional Cleanup (if previous install exists)
bash uninstall.sh

🚀 Run Setup
bash setup.sh

This will:
- Install or rebuild the rtw88-dkms-git driver
- Apply stability fixes (ASPM & deep sleep)
- Create a pacman hook for auto-repair on kernel updates
- Reload your Wi-Fi driver instantly

Then reboot once:
sudo reboot

🔧 Manual Repair (if Wi-Fi breaks again)
sudo /usr/local/bin/fix-rtl8822ce.sh

This rebuilds and reloads the Wi-Fi driver on the spot.

🔄 Auto-Repair on Kernel Update
After every pacman -Syu, your system automatically:
- Detects kernel change
- Rebuilds DKMS module
- Reloads the Realtek driver

No manual steps required.

🧠 Notes

- Requires DKMS and yay installed
- Stable driver options added automatically

✅ Summary
